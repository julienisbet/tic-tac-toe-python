# PSEUDOCODE # create a variable board initialize with dictionary with 9 keys 1-9
# create variable called active, set to true
# create a variable current_player, set to 'X', create variable next_player set it to 'O'
# while active is true
  # print the board state
  # set valid_move to none
  # while valid_move is not true
    # ask current_player to pick a square
    # check if the square is valid
    # if valid, set valid_move to true and update board
  # if player has won -- print message, set active to false
  # else if board full -- print message, set active to false
  # else set current player to other player

# Tic Tac Toe, by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com
# The classic board game.
